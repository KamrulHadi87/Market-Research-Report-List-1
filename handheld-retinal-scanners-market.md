<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Retinal Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>No Mydriasis</li><li>Mydriasis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld retinal scanners market is segmented into two main types: no mydriasis and mydriasis. No mydriasis devices allow retinal imaging without the need for pupil dilation, making the process quicker and more comfortable for patients. These are particularly useful for routine screenings and quick assessments. Mydriasis devices, on the other hand, require pupil dilation to capture high-resolution images of the retina, providing detailed insights essential for diagnosing various eye conditions. Both types cater to different clinical needs and patient preferences.</p></p>
