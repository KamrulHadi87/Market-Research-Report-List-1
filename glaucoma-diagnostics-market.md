<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma Diagnostics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Angle Glaucoma</li><li>Low Tension Glaucoma</li><li>Pigmentary Glaucoma</li><li>Closed Angle Glaucoma</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glaucoma diagnostics market is categorized into various types based on the condition's characteristics. Open Angle Glaucoma, the most common type, features gradual vision loss due to blocked drainage canals. Low Tension Glaucoma occurs with normal eye pressure but still causes optic nerve damage. Pigmentary Glaucoma arises from pigment dispersion affecting fluid drainage. Closed Angle Glaucoma results from a sudden blockage of fluid outflow, leading to rapid symptoms. Other categories may include secondary glaucomas and less common types, each necessitating specialized diagnostic approaches.</p></p>
